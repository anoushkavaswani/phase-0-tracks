# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is an organizational system that keeps track of changes over time such that you can understand the changes that have been made and go back to earlier versions too. It is useful because you can recover earlier versions of a project and understand what has happened to a project. Especially if you are working on something with multiple individuals, having a system that keeps track of changes is very important.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a duplicated version of a depository.  It lets you make changes and work independently without disrupting the live, master version of that repository.  You can later decide to merge your changes into the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is analogous to saving a file.  When you make a set of changes to a file, you upload these changes by commiting them.  When you commit, Github saves the changes, records the timestamp and records the author.  The author also adds a commit message with their changes.  A good commit message clarly explains the changes you made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when the commit has a change to be merged in one place but the current master has a change in the same place.  Git does not know which change to use.
